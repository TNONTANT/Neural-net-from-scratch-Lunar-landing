# Neural-net-from-scratch-Lunar-landing
This project builds a neural network model from scratch, without external libraries, to gain a deep understanding of deep learning concepts. Collected data is used, and essential components like feedforward and backpropagation are implemented. It enhances comprehension of the underlying principles behind deep learning.
